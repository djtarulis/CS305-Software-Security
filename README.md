# CS305-Software-Security


    Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
      - Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. They required a modern operation of their current web application. This included a secure way to transfer data for clients and financial data. 
    What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
      - The things I did well when finding the client's software security vulnerabilities included identifying errors or out of date elements in the source code and using resources given to me like the vulnerability assessment flow diagram. Secure code benefits the client as well as their users on a large scale. A single attack can leak several thousands of user's secure information. A company cannot be reputable or function properly if the security risks are not taken care of.
    What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
      - The entire assessment was a challenge at the start. Once you pick up on the patterns and know what to look for it becomes much easier and can be cross referenced when looking at new code you have never seen before. 
    How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
      - Increasing security included self created certificates and checksums to verify secure connections to a server. Algorithm ciphers were also used to encrypt data when transferred to the server. 
    How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
      - The Maven Dependency Vulnerability Check was the main way to check for vulnerabilities. Running the check on the latest version shows any known vulnerabilities, however there are often several false positives.
    What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
      - StackExchange is always a big help. General searches on problems you are having also usually give some sort of help or guidance that is helpful.
    Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
      - I would show employers that I can successfully utilize algorithm ciphers to encrypt data. I would also like to show employers that much of the skills used during this course relied on knowing how to search for a solution when stuck with a problem.
